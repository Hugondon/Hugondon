# Hi there ðŸ‘‹.
## About Me
I'm Hugo PÃ©rez, undergraduate of Telecommunications and Electronic Engineering.

âš¡ My main interests are:
  - Microcontroller (AVR, STM & ESP32) firmware development for various applications, including IoT and Digital Processing.
  - Python programming to complement hardware projects (GUIs). Maybe a project using Django Framework coming soon... ðŸ˜„
  - Microprocessor Design using FPGAs programmed in VHDL

## Projects I've worked on.

  - Recreation of an 8 bit Microcontroller (ATmega16) main logic using VHDL and finally implemented on a DE2 - 115 board.
  - Guitar string tuner (kinda) using MATLAB and FFT, including a GUI.
  - A basic Synthesizer emulation using a NUCLEO-F767ZI board connected to a Yamaha PSR - 175 MIDI keyboard. 
  - A recreation of the Tetris game using a bluepill board, LED matrices, an OLED display and a pair of speakers.
  - A basic Task Manager using C.

## What I'm currently learning...
- General use of RTOS in the embedded world.
- Django Framework.
- Bash Scripting.
- Embedded C++.
